# Naudix
naudix is a discord music or audio bot made by me. it is made entirely in java using the java discord api (jda) library
this is entirely free and open source

## Features
naudix currently can:

1. load songs from spotify and youtube
2. search youtube for videos and loading the top one
3. a functional queue
4. it has volume control

## Limitations
the only real limitation is that it only works in one server at a time.
I never bothered to set up database compatibility in order to support multiple servers since i wasnt exactly that commited.
Plus i never really planned to use it since it was just a project i started.

## Why did i start making it?
idk. woke up one day and i was like "you know what would be fun? making a discord music bot" and thus spent the next week working on it

## Will i ever finish it?
idk maybe. if someone wants me to then sure dm me Nix3l#6653

## Can i yoink the source code?
as long as you abide by the gplv3 license (i.e. you have to keep your code open source too), then yes.
and it would be nice if you credited me somewhere too

## -----
ik the code isnt the neatest thing in the world in some places but eh i didnt make this with the intention of making the best code.
i just wanted to get a working prototype up.
